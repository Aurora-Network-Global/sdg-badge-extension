## 🔧 **RECOMMENDED FIXES**

### Fix Close Button Issue
The close button event listener might not be properly attached or the hideWidget() function needs debugging.

**Suggested fix in content.js:**
```javascript
// In createWidget() method, ensure close button event listener is properly attached
this.widget.querySelector('.sdg-widget-close').addEventListener('click', (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    e.stopPropagation();
    this.hideWidget();
});

// Ensure hideWidget() method properly hides the widget
hideWidget() {
    if (this.widget) {
        this.widget.style.display = 'none';
        this.isVisible = false;
    }
}
```
