# SDG Badge Extension - UI Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the resolution of 4 critical UI issues in the SDG Badge browser extension:

1. **CSS Interference**: Extension CSS affecting entire webpage
2. **Popup Width Issue**: Popup window too narrow, hover content cut off
3. **Floating Mode Problems**: Indefinite "analyzing content..." and broken close button
4. **Sidebar Text Visibility**: White text on white background issue

## Issue 1: CSS Interference Fix ✅

**Problem**: Extension's `widget.css` contained global selectors (`h1`, `h2`, `.description`, etc.) that were affecting the entire webpage, causing layout issues.

**Solution**:
- **File Modified**: `assets/css/widget.css`
- **Changes Made**:
  - Namespaced all CSS selectors to only apply to extension elements
  - Added specific selectors like `.sdg-badge-widget .h1`, `.sdg-badge-container .h1`
  - Added CSS isolation injection in `content.js` with `injectCSSIsolation()` method
  - Prevented global style pollution using CSS containment

**Result**: Webpage layouts are no longer affected by extension CSS. All styles are properly isolated to extension components only.

## Issue 2: Popup Width Fix ✅

**Problem**: Popup window was only 300px wide, causing the "Top 3 SDG classifications" hover content to be cut off.

**Solution**:
- **File Modified**: `popup/popup.css`
- **Changes Made**:
  - Increased popup width from `300px` to `420px` (line 134)
  - Adjusted `.sdg-legend` positioning and width for popup mode:
    - Left position: `50px` (adjusted for popup)
    - Width: `320px` (fits within 420px popup width)
  - Created popup-specific legend positioning in `widget.css`

**Result**: Popup window is now wide enough to accommodate all hover content without truncation.

## Issue 3: Floating Mode Fix ✅

**Problem**: Floating widget showed "Analyzing content..." indefinitely and close button didn't work properly.

**Solution**:
- **File Modified**: `scripts/content.js`
- **Changes Made**:
  - Simplified `displayResults()` method to create a direct SDG display instead of complex widget loading
  - Replaced complex widget initialization with simple HTML display showing:
    - SDG goal number
    - Confidence percentage
    - SDG icon
  - Fixed close button event listener with proper null checking
  - Ensured proper data flow from API to display

**Result**: Floating widget now displays SDG analysis results immediately and close button works correctly.

## Issue 4: Sidebar Text Visibility Fix ✅

**Problem**: White text on white background made "Top 3 SDG classifications" unreadable in sidebar.

**Solution**:
- **Files Modified**: `assets/css/widget.css` and `sidebar/sidebar.css`
- **Changes Made**:
  - Removed conflicting styles from `widget.css` for sidebar legend
  - Enhanced `sidebar.css` with proper contrast:
    - Background: `#f8f9fa` (light gray)
    - Text color: `#212529` (dark gray) with `!important` flags
    - Added specific styling for `h3`, `li`, `p`, and `a` elements
    - Added border for better definition

**Result**: Sidebar text is now clearly visible with proper dark text on light background contrast.
